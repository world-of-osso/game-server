# Toy Box server foundation

Account-wide toy learning/favourites are separate from the legacy per-character mount/pet collection. Toy identity comes from locally extracted Retail Toy.db2, not item names or invented lists. [Contract](../../specs/toys.md).

## Catalog preparation

Extract FDID988200 with `casc-local` from the local WoW install. Store the DB2 under the engine's persistent data tree. Then run:

```text
python3 scripts/export-toys.py <988200.db2> <engine>/data/db2/12.1.0.69933/Toy.csv --exporter <engine>/scripts/export_db2_csv.py
python3 scripts/import-toys.py <Toy.csv> data/world.db --report <joins.json>
```

The wrapper registers WoWDBDefs layout821B5D20 with the engine's maintained WDC5 decoder; unknown encrypted records are dropped by that decoder. The importer atomically replaces only the `toy` reference table. It preserves every decrypted identity and writes unresolved joins to the requested report. Runtime joins Item/ItemSparse and the first on-use ItemXItemEffect→ItemEffect ordered by LegacySlotIndex/ID, matching item-use catalog selection. Missing runtime content_item definitions remain unavailable rather than receiving substitute templates. Startup fails explicitly if the reference table has not been prepared.

## Account state and transport

`account_toys` stores a bitcode map `item_id -> favourite` keyed by account. Learning on normal UseItem writes both ownership and the consumed inventory record in one redb transaction. A duplicate returns an error without consumption. Favourite updates reread the durable account row inside their write transaction.

ToyCollectionUpdate on CollectionChannel carries the full catalog and learned/favourite flags. Initial world entry and each learning/favourite change publish it; updates broadcast to every in-world connection authenticated to that account. Other accounts remain independent. SetToyFavourite and UseToy are client-to-server requests on the same channel. ToyResult identifies Learn/Favourite/Use and carries an optional error; learning also retains the normal InventoryError refusal path.

## Activation boundary

UseToy checks ownership, raw metadata, runtime item eligibility and complete reachable spell preflight before dispatch. Registry-unhandled effects/auras and script-only auras fail explicitly. Aura56 requires a real nonzero creature template; zero-entry special costumes are not implemented. Summon28 requires available properties, supported control and a creature template. Area-trigger179 without a trigger binding/radius is lifecycle-only and unavailable as a toy action. Unsupported implicit targets and trigger depth/cycles are reported too.

Supported casts use the existing start_cast pipeline. A per-cast spell clone applies ItemEffect recovery/category overrides; negative values retain SpellCooldowns. SpellCooldownUpdate reports the actual category and durations, including item recovery. ToyResult success means **cast started**, not completed; SpellGo/CastFailed remain the later outcome. Existing character SpellHistory lifetime is unchanged; server-restart cooldown persistence is not added.

## Proof and coverage

Pinned local export:1166 decrypted toys. Concrete behavioural fixtures cover Orb of Deception1973 learning/consumption; Time-Lost Figurine32782 spell41301, durable account favourite, second-character relog/reopen, same-account broadcast and cooldown rejection; Eagger Basket188698 spell61810 uses ItemEffect category1203/10s instead of spell category44, rejects repeat and works after expiry; Flag of Ownership38578 rejects unsupported effect3 without starting cooldown. Census output records every root effect/aura and unavailable type including triggered spell chains. These are CPU/loopback proofs, not rendered client or live Retail parity.
